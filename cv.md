## **Briefly about Myself:**

Studied at Bauman Moscow State Technical University for 4 years, specializing in nuclear reactors and materials. In parallel, working as a design engineer in a design bureau of the same direction. Routine monotonous work and the lack of new ideas and development forced me to leave. I've been looking for my "dream job" for the last couple of years. A year ago I became interested in the IT field and at the moment I am almost completely immersed in its study.I took several courses on stepik.org this year and the choice was javascript. Hope that over time the desire will not decrease, the industry is very interesting. And really hope to reach great heights in it.

## **Skill and Profiency:**
- HTML5, CSS3
- JavaScript Basics
- Git, GitHub
- VS Code
